Further, assume WLOG that the center of $S_{2}$ is above the line $y=\\frac{1}{2}$ and to the right of the line $x=\\frac{1}{2}$, determined by the center of $S_{1}$. There are three cases to consider: - the right side of $S_{1}$ and the left side of $S_{2}$ are 5 units apart, and the bottom left vertex of $S_{2}$ lies under the line $y=1$; - the top side of $S_{1}$ and the bottom side of $S_{2}$ are 5 units apart, and the bottom left vertex of $S_{2}$ lies to the left of the line $x=1$; - the bottom left coordinate of $S_{2}$ is $(a, b)$ with $a, b \\geq 1$, and $5=\\sqrt{(a-1)^{2}+(b-1)^{2}}$. We see that the first two cases are symmetric, so consider the case where the left edge of $S_{2}$ lies on the line $x=6$.
